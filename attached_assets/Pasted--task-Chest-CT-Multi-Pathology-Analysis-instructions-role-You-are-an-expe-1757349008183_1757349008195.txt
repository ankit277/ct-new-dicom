    "rules": {
      "COPD": "Identify only if diffuse low-attenuation, hyperinflation, vascular pruning, or bronchial wall thickening are present. Do NOT classify a single cavity as COPD.",
      "ILD": "Identify only if there are reticular opacities, honeycombing, traction bronchiectasis, or diffuse ground-glass patterns. Localized lesions do not qualify.",
      "Pulmonary Embolism": "Identify only if there is a definite intraluminal filling defect in pulmonary arteries on contrast CT. If non-contrast CT, mark as indeterminate.",
      "Pneumonia": "Identify only if there is alveolar consolidation, air bronchograms, or lobar/segmental ground-glass opacity. Do not confuse with cavities.",
      "Tuberculosis": "Identify if there are thick-walled cavities (especially in upper lobes), tree-in-bud nodules, or chronic sequelae (fibrosis, calcification, bronchiectasis).",
      "Pleural Effusion": "Identify if there is homogeneous fluid density in pleural space with crescentic or layering opacity. Do not confuse cavities with pleural effusion.",
      "Pneumothorax": "Identify only if there is air in the pleural space with a visible visceral pleural line and absent lung markings beyond. Not an intraparenchymal cavity."
