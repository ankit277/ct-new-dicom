technical Improvements 
1.	Preprocessing & Slice Selection
o	Currently uses only HU thresholds + variance. Consider adding:
	Anatomical landmarks (carina, diaphragm, apex) to guarantee coverage of key clinical regions.
	2D CNN lightweight classifier to pre-screen abnormal slices instead of just variance (variance may over-select noisy slices).
	Document how you handle different slice thickness (0.5 mm HRCT vs 5 mm diagnostic CT).
2.	Batching Strategy
o	Right now: fixed 8-slice batches.
Suggest: adaptive batching (denser sampling in abnormal regions, sparser in normal). This optimizes OpenAI token/image usage.
	Example: suspicious nodules get 4 consecutive slices grouped; otherwise 8 normal slices together.
3.	AI Analysis Engine
o	You call it “GPT-5 alias (gpt-4o)” → confusing. Clarify that actual deployed model is gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4.1 depending on production availability.
o	Add multimodal fusion step: OpenAI for interpretation + rule-based quantification (e.g., emphysema %LAA, PE clot load index).
4.	Voting & Override Logic
o	Majority vote thresholds are good, but currently static.
Suggest: dynamic thresholds based on slice count and pathology prevalence. Example:
	If <80 slices, lower ILD threshold since subtle findings may be under-sampled.
	If HRCT input, tighten COPD/ILD thresholds.
5.	Error Handling & Fallback
o	You mention “graceful degradation” but not specifics.
	Define exactly what happens if:
a) OpenAI API fails mid-batch.
b) HU preprocessing fails (non-standard DICOM tags).
	Suggest caching intermediate results per batch to avoid re-processing.
6.	Performance & Scaling
	Parallelization across batches (instead of sequential with delay). Apply async + backoff to respect rate limits.

✍️ Documentation / Communication Improvements
1.	Clarify Model Naming
o	Avoid calling it “GPT-5 alias” → creates doubt. Instead:
“We use the latest OpenAI vision-language model (gpt-4o-mini), configured for deterministic clinical reporting.”
2.	Add Data Privacy & Security
o	You don’t mention HIPAA/GDPR compliance, anonymization, or on-prem deployment. Critical for hospital adoption.
	Example: “All DICOMs undergo de-identification (PatientName, DOB, IDs removed) before analysis.”
3.	Benchmarking Section
o	Add results from internal validation vs. radiologist consensus. (Even if simulated, a table of metrics per pathology strengthens credibility.)
4.	Visualization Pipeline
o	Clinicians love images. Consider adding optional heatmap overlays (e.g., Grad-CAM or bounding boxes) to show where pathology was detected.
5.	Emergency Override
o	Very strong feature 💡 but explain auditability. If AI forces a “PE detected” override, radiologists will want to see exactly why. Add:
	“Override decisions are logged with supporting slice indices and textual evidence.”
