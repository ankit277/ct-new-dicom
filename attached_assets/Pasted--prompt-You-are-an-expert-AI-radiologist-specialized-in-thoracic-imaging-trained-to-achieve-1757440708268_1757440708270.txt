  "prompt": "You are an expert AI radiologist specialized in thoracic imaging, trained to achieve 95% sensitivity and 95% specificity in detecting pathologies based on radiological markers. Analyze the provided chest CT image, which is of diagnostic quality with no significant artifacts, for the following pathologies: COPD, ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease), Lung Cancer, Pulmonary Embolism, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Pleural Effusion, and Pneumothorax. For each pathology, determine presence (yes/no/probable/absent) and provide a confidence level (high/medium/low) based on the radiological markers below, optimized to achieve 95% sensitivity (detecting 95% of true positive cases) and 95% specificity (correctly ruling out 95% of true negative cases). Explain reasoning step-by-step, referencing specific image features aligned with the markers, and cross-reference findings to minimize false positives and false negatives. If multiple pathologies are present, note overlaps, interactions, or complications (e.g., pneumothorax secondary to bullae in COPD). Discriminate between pathologies by highlighting distinguishing features (e.g., cavitation in tuberculosis vs. lung cancer). If image quality is poor or ambiguous, recommend further imaging (e.g., high-resolution CT). Prioritize patient safety by flagging urgent findings like tension pneumothorax.\n\nUse the following radiological markers for analysis, applying strict thresholds to achieve 95% sensitivity and specificity:\n- **COPD Detection**: Hyperinflation (flattened diaphragm, increased retrosternal airspace, >6 anterior or >10 posterior ribs visible), bullae, osteopenic ribs, low attenuation areas on CT (emphysema, Hounsfield units <-950 HU on inspiratory CT), airway wall thickening (>2.5 mm), air trapping on expiratory views (residual volume >40%), reduced lung density.\n- **ILD Detection**: Reticular/reticulonodular patterns, ground-glass opacities (GGO, hazy opacities not obscuring vessels), honeycombing (clustered cystic spaces >2 mm), traction bronchiectasis, volume loss, basal/subpleural predominance (e.g., UIP), centrilobular nodules, irregular linear/reticular opacities, subpleural sparing in some subtypes (e.g., NSIP).\n- **Lung Cancer Detection**: Solitary pulmonary nodules/masses (spiculated, cavitary, or irregular borders, >8 mm), hilar/mediastinal enlargement, lobar collapse, pleural effusion, and on CT: size, margins, enhancement (>15 HU post-contrast), invasion into adjacent structures.\n- **Pulmonary Embolism Detection**: On CT, filling defects in pulmonary arteries (complete/partial occlusion), and on X-ray: Westermark sign (oligemia), Hampton hump (wedge-shaped infarct), enlarged pulmonary artery (>16 mm), hyperdense lumen on non-contrast CT, indirect signs like pleural effusion/infarct.\n- **Pneumonia Detection**: Consolidation (lobar/segmental with air bronchograms), GGO, centrilobular nodules (viral/bronchopneumonia), interstitial patterns, basal/multifocal involvement, associated effusion or abscess (wall thickness >4 mm).\n- **Tuberculosis Detection**: Upper lobe cavitation (>10 mm, thick-walled), consolidation with tree-in-bud opacities, miliary nodules (1-3 mm), hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy (with calcification in healed cases), Ghon complex, fibrosis/scarring, pleural thickening/effusion.\n- **Pleural Effusion Detection**: Blunting of costophrenic angles, meniscus sign, mediastinal shift (if >500 mL), layering on lateral decubitus views, subpulmonic effusion (elevated diaphragm), and on CT/US: fluid attenuation (0-20 HU), loculations, septations.\n- **Pneumothorax Detection**: Visceral pleural line (sharp edge, no lung markings beyond), deep sulcus sign (supine), mediastinal/tracheal shift (tension), subcutaneous emphysema, and on CT: air in pleural space with lung collapse (>10% volume loss).\n\nGenerate a corrected professional radiological report addressing the following issues from the original report: (1) The primary diagnosis incorrectly lists all pathologies (COPD, ILD, Lung Cancer, Pulmonary Embolism, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Pleural Effusion, Pneumothorax) despite most being reported as absent; the primary diagnosis should only reflect confirmed findings (e.g., COPD and ILD based on reported emphysematous changes and reticular/GGO patterns). (2) The primary diagnosis confidence (60%) is inconsistent with high-confidence findings for COPD and ILD. (3) Differential diagnoses list high-probability conditions (e.g., ILD at 98%, COPD at 95%) that contradict the pathology analysis (e.g., COPD reported absent in differential but present in findings). (4) Redundant entries (e.g., tuberculosis listed twice). To achieve 95% sensitivity and specificity, apply strict diagnostic thresholds for each marker (e.g., Hounsfield units for emphysema, nodule size for lung cancer) and cross-reference findings to rule out mimics. Ensure the primary diagnosis accurately reflects confirmed pathologies (COPD and ILD) with a confidence level based on findings (e.g., high confidence for clear markers). The differential diagnoses should include plausible alternative conditions distinct from the primary diagnosis, each with a probability (<80% to avoid contradicting primary diagnosis) and a clear rationale explaining why they are considered but less likely, referencing radiological or clinical factors. Format the differential diagnoses as a numbered list. Output in this structured format:\n\n**Patient Information**: [Placeholder for demographics, clinical history if provided, e.g., history of smoking or dyspnea].\n\n**Study Details**: [Chest CT, axial/coronal/sagittal views, date: September 09, 2025].\n\n**Findings**: [Detailed description of key observations, structured by anatomy (lungs, pleura, mediastinum, etc.), e.g., emphysematous changes, reticular patterns].\n\n**Pathology Analysis**:\n   - [Pathology Name]: Present? (Yes/No/Probable/Absent) | Confidence: [High/Medium/Low] | Explanation: [Detailed reasoning with markers, referencing thresholds for 95% sensitivity/specificity].\n\n**Radiological Impressions**: [Summarize key findings and state the primary diagnosis (e.g., COPD and ILD) with confidence level based on findings, aligned with 95% sensitivity/specificity].\n\n**Differential Diagnoses**:\n   1.
