Preprocessing & Slice Selection

Currently uses only HU thresholds + variance. Consider adding:

Anatomical landmarks (carina, diaphragm, apex) to guarantee coverage of key clinical regions.

2D CNN lightweight classifier to pre-screen abnormal slices instead of just variance (variance may over-select noisy slices).

Document how you handle different slice thickness (0.5 mm HRCT vs 5 mm diagnostic CT).

Batching Strategy

Right now: fixed 8-slice batches.
Suggest: adaptive batching (denser sampling in abnormal regions, sparser in normal). This optimizes OpenAI token/image usage.

Example: suspicious nodules get 4 consecutive slices grouped; otherwise 8 normal slices together.

AI Analysis Engine

You call it “GPT-5 alias (gpt-4o)” → confusing. Clarify that actual deployed model is gpt-4o-mini or gpt-4.1 depending on production availability.

Add multimodal fusion step: OpenAI for interpretation + rule-based quantification (e.g., emphysema %LAA, PE clot load index).

Voting & Override Logic

Majority vote thresholds are good, but currently static.
Suggest: dynamic thresholds based on slice count and pathology prevalence. Example:

If <80 slices, lower ILD threshold since subtle findings may be under-sampled.

If HRCT input, tighten COPD/ILD thresholds.

Error Handling & Fallback

You mention “graceful degradation” but not specifics.

Define exactly what happens if:
a) OpenAI API fails mid-batch.
b) HU preprocessing fails (non-standard DICOM tags).

Suggest caching intermediate results per batch to avoid re-processing.

Performance & Scaling

Current timing (~2–3 min for large studies) is good, but you should add:

Parallelization across batches (instead of sequential with delay). Apply async + backoff to respect rate limits.

GPU preprocessing (CuPy or PyTorch) to accelerate HU calculations for 1000+ slices.

Clinical Output

Right now, report aggregation merges findings into JSON + narrative.
Suggest: add RadLex ontology mapping → standardized terminology. This makes integration with PACS/RIS easier.

Also include structured DICOM SR export (not just JSON).

✍️ Documentation / Communication Improvements

Clarify Model Naming

Avoid calling it “GPT-5 alias” → creates doubt. Instead:

“We use the latest OpenAI vision-language model (gpt-4o-mini), configured for deterministic clinical reporting.”

Add Data Privacy & Security

You don’t mention HIPAA/GDPR compliance, anonymization, or on-prem deployment. Critical for hospital adoption.

Example: “All DICOMs undergo de-identification (PatientName, DOB, IDs removed) before analysis.”

Benchmarking Section

Add results from internal validation vs. radiologist consensus. (Even if simulated, a table of metrics per pathology strengthens credibility.)

Visualization Pipeline

Clinicians love images. Consider adding optional heatmap overlays (e.g., Grad-CAM or bounding boxes) to show where pathology was detected.

Clinical Workflow Integration

Expand on PACS/RIS/HIS integration (DICOMweb, HL7, FHIR). Right now it’s API-centric, but radiologists will ask: “Can I see this in my PACS viewer?”

Emergency Override

Very strong feature 💡 but explain auditability. If AI forces a “PE detected” override, radiologists will want to see exactly why. Add:

“Override decisions are logged with supporting slice indices and textual evidence.”
