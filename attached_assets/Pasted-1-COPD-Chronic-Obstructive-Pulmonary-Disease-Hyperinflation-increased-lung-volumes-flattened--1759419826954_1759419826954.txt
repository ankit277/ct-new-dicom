1. COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)

Hyperinflation → increased lung volumes, flattened diaphragms

Low attenuation areas (≤ –950 HU) → emphysematous change

Bullae / blebs → focal air-filled spaces without wall

Airway wall thickening → bronchial wall > 2 mm

Air trapping on expiratory CT

Reduced vascular markings in affected zones

2. ILD (Interstitial Lung Disease)

Reticular pattern → interlobular septal thickening, intralobular lines

Honeycombing → stacked cystic airspaces, usually subpleural

Ground-glass opacities (GGOs)

Traction bronchiectasis → dilated bronchi within fibrotic regions

Subpleural & basal predominance (UIP pattern)

Crazy paving pattern (GGOs + septal thickening)

3. Lung Cancer

Spiculated or irregular nodule/mass

Lobulated margins

Cavitation with irregular wall

Air bronchograms through mass (adenocarcinoma feature)

Pleural retraction / fissural distortion

Size > 8 mm with growth over time

Mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy

Invasion of chest wall or mediastinum

4. Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

Intraluminal filling defect in pulmonary arteries

Vessel cutoff sign

Enlarged pulmonary arteries (acute PE)

Right heart strain:

RV/LV ratio > 1

Reflux of contrast into IVC/hepatic veins

Wedge-shaped peripheral infarct (Hampton hump)

Oligemia distal to clot (Westermark sign)

5. Pneumonia

Consolidation with air bronchograms

Ground-glass opacities (GGOs)

Tree-in-bud nodules (bronchopneumonia)

Centrilobular nodules

Lobar or segmental distribution

Pleural effusion (parapneumonic or empyema)

6. Tuberculosis (TB)

Apical/posterior upper lobe cavitation

Tree-in-bud opacities (endobronchial spread)

Fibro-calcified scars (old healed TB)

Bronchiectasis in upper lobes

Miliary nodules (hematogenous spread)

Caseating necrosis within nodes (rim enhancement, central low attenuation)

7. Pleural Effusion

Blunting of costophrenic angle

Meniscus sign

Dependent fluid with layering on decubitus CT

Mediastinal shift (large effusion)

Loculated collections (empyema)

Pleural thickening / enhancement (suggests TB or malignancy)

8. Pneumothorax

Visceral pleural line separated from chest wall

Absence of lung markings beyond pleural line

Deep sulcus sign (supine patient)

Collapsed lung parenchyma retracted toward hilum

Tension pneumothorax signs: mediastinal shift, diaphragmatic inversion
